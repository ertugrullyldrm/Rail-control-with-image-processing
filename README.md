# Railway Error Detection System

This project aims to prevent loss of life and property by detecting potential errors that may occur on railway lines in advance. The system provides continuous monitoring of railway lines using high-resolution image processing techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms.

## Project Features

1. **High Definition Image Processing**
 The developed system continuously scans railway lines with high-resolution cameras and collects image data. This data is processed to identify potential errors.

2. **Artificial Intelligence Algorithms**
 Artificial intelligence algorithms integrated with image processing techniques are trained to detect anomalies on railway lines. These algorithms use deep learning models to detect and classify errors.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**
 The system operates in real time, providing continuous monitoring and detecting any potential errors immediately. In this way, rapid intervention and preventive maintenance can be performed.

4. **Data Analysis and Reporting**
 The collected data is analyzed and detailed reports are created about the causes and frequencies of errors. These reports provide important information for the maintenance and safety of railway lines.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**
 The system's interface is designed to allow users to easily view and analyze data. Users can quickly see the errors detected and the precautions that need to be taken.

## Usage areas

- **Railway Companies:** Can use it to ensure the safety of lines and reduce maintenance costs.
- **Ministries of Transport:** Can have information about the general condition of the railway infrastructure and take the necessary measures.
- **Research Institutions:** Can contribute to studies in the field of image processing and artificial intelligence.
